first  :the rover will convert the images / video feed it takes from the enviroments + bird view projections to approximate 
and make the planes 
( in this case being the terrain surrounding it) to 2 dimensional plane to simplify the task 
next this terrain is devided into 15 x 15 grid for singular computational learning processes 
then give coordinate steps for our rover to map over and give feedback to the team back in the mars basement. 
based on this feedback loop the astronaust (and ground control on planet earth) can optimize and decide on paths 
with most valuable and less risky and resource wasting trajectories .
